## Install

Warning: requires :zap: **magick** :zap:

* [graphicsmagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If you have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you can use that to quickly install `graphicsmagick`. The rest of the program can be easily installed with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
brew install graphicsmagick
npm install himawari-history
```

If you want to use the video scripts in `examples`, you'll also need [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org), which can also be installed with homebrew.

```
brew ffmpeg
```

## Usage

Here's an example showing all options:

```js
var hh = require('himawari-history')
var moment = require('moment')
var path = require('path')

hh({
  start: new Date(moment().subtract(1, 'days').format()),
  end: new Date(),
  interval: 10,
  outdir: path.join(__dirname, 'images'),
  debug: false,
  concurrency: 10,
  zoom: 1,
  infrared: false,
  parallel: false,
  onFileSuccess: function (outfile) {
    console.log(`✅  ${outfile}`)
  }
}, function () {
  console.log('✅  all done')
})
```

Here's how I downloaded all Himawari 8 images at the base zoom level (1d). This is kind of intense, not recommended for your first spin.

```js
var hh = require('himawari-history')

// Site states:
// "Himawari-8 started operation at 02 UTC on 7 July 2015."
// http://www.data.jma.go.jp/mscweb/en/himawari89/
// All I see is 404s until this date:
var THE_BEGINNING = new Date('Tue, 07 Jul 2015 9:00:00 GMT')

hh({
  debug: true,
  start: THE_BEGINNING,
  concurrency: 20,
  onFileSuccess: function (outfile) {
    console.log(`✅  ${outfile}`)
  }
}, function () {
  console.log('✅  all done')
})
```

The `examples` directory has all the scripts I'm working with, including `video.js` for visible light and `video-infrared.js` for infrared. The video scripts require images downloaded from the other scripts. This is very thrown together and experimental. Please let me know if you're interested in taking it further!
